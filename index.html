   <p><strong>5. Predator Missle</strong></p>
     <div class="img-ranking">
     <img src="./media/predatormissile.png" alt="photo of predator missile" class="predatormissileimg">
     <p>Predator Missle is a 5 point killstreak which lets you control a rocket coming straight down onto the map. If used 
    correctly and with a little luck, this can help kill multiple players at once; which can lead to your other killstreaks.
    This can also take out other people's killstreaks in the sky or ground. It's versality and low amount of kills to get,
    makes this a top 5 killstreak in MW3</p>

 <div class="ac130">
  <p><strong>4. AC-130</strong></p>
    <div class="img-ranking">
     <img src="./media/ac130.png" alt="photo of ac130">
     <p>AC-130 is a 12 point killstreak which lets you control a gunship's array of 3 missle types. A classic killstreak from
    MW2, this does require some some sort of skill because of the limited camera angles; however if used correctly, you can
    get a good amount of kills using this. It's variety of missles makes this a nightmare for the opposing team, and allows
    your squad to get an advantage in whatever gamemode.. which makes this a top 5 killstreak in MW3.

 <div class="pavelow">
    <p><strong>3. Pave Low</strong></p>
     <div class="img-ranking">
      <img src="./media/pavelow.png" alt="photo of pave low">
      <p>Pave Low is a 12 point killstreak which summons a heavily armored assault helicopter that attacks enemies. 
        The Pave Low is harder to destroy and packs a bigger punch than the regular Attack Helicopter. If used in a open map 
        with not that much buildings, this can cause alot of damage to the opposition.. as well as it helping you get your 
        higher killstreaks.

    <div class="reaper">
     <p><strong>2. Reaper</strong></p>
      <div class="img-ranking">
       <img src="./media/reaper.png" alt="photo of reaper">
       <p>Reaper is a 9 point killstreak which allows you to control a gunship with approximately 9 guided missles ready to be
        unleashed on the enemy. It has a smooth, slow and accurate gun fire compare to the AC-130, however, both camera
        angles are the same. If used correctly, can rack up kills in a hurry.

        <p><strong>1. Osprey Gunner</strong></p>
         <div class="ospreygunner">
          <img src="./media/ospreygunner.png" alt="photo of osprey gunner">
          <p>Osprey Gunner is a 17 point killstreak which allows you to control a gunship with a machine gun, and drops 4
            care packages for your squad. Hands down the best killstreak in this game because of how easy it is to get kills,
            as well as it giving your squad a chance to get useful killstreaks through the care package.
